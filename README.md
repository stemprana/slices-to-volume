# slices-to-volume
Python pipeline for brain slices registration and volume reconstruction.

## Overview
Input datasets consist of images of mouse brain slices mounted sequentially after histological procedures. 
Large field of view images are obtained at two different resolutions.
- Lower resolution images are used for regsitration purposes.
- Higher resoltion images are used for a detailed analysis of area of interest.

Pipeline is aimed at perfoming registration on lower resolution *zoomed-out* images and applying transormations to higer resolution *zoomed-in* datasets.

Overalapping region of transformed *zoomed-in* images is obtained and a volumetric reconstruction generated.
